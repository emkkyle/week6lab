## Birthday Countdown

This program is designed to **inform the user of the number of days until their upcoming birthday**. It takes the user's birthday and current date as inputs and output the days until the user's next birthday, as well as their age.

## Usage

This program is made in Python, but any version should suffice.

(Example of output below)

```bash
What is your name? Emily

What is your birth month? (MM)  03

What is your birth day? (DD) 26

What is your birth year? (YYYY) 2002

What month is it today? (MM) 10

What day is it today? (DD) 04

What year is it today? (YYYY) 2020

Hi Emily, there are 173 days until your 18 birthday!
```

## Installation and Use

## Choosing the License and CoC

I chose the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license because I believed it was best fit to my needs: I completely welcome people taking my code and making adjustments and edits to it, and it does not bother me if they redistribute it privately or not-mostly because I am not planning on benefitting from or really using this code outside of the project it was made for.

I chose the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md) because, after reading through it, it was entirely in line with what I had in mind for a Code of Conduct, and I felt that it would set up a space that is welcoming but also protects all users.
