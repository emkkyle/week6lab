# week6lab
I had a migraine the day of the lab and only revisited the video to complete the lab today, unknowing it was supposed to be a group project, unfortunately, everyone I was able to contact was already in a group and already submitted or finished their work, so I was forced to complete the assignment alone--if there is anyone else working alone or who couldn't find a group, I'd love to join theirs for the rest of the project for this upcoming week

My program takes the user's name and birthday and the current date and calculates the days until the user's next birthday.
